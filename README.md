This is a web project made by 4 students around the end of our 2nd year of engineering school.

The aim was to create a site where you could search, discover, read mangas, here's the frontpage :

We used html css to create the skeleton of pages and were forced to use JBoss as backend (spoiler alert its horrible, we spent countless hours trying to figure out what wasn't working and why)
Each manga was planned to have a generic page such as this one , but we didnt have time to make it connect to our database.

And finally we also implemented a login system, which we wanted to be used by users to add books to their favorites, and create comments on the book's page.
